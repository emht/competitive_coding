# Competitive Coding
This is a Git-Repository made by me during the process of learning competitive programming and version control system as GIT.

## Structure of the Repository
The structure of this repository is as following:

* The repository contains two file named, gatherQuestion.py and Submit.py which are WIP, and meant to help in gathering few questions to solve and help to submit those solutions.
* CPP folder contains all the problem solved in c++ language
* python folder contains all the problem solved in python language
* README.md file describes all the specifications and details of this repository, recursively :P.


## Structure of Each file
Each code file in this repository has the following structure:

* On top of the code file, there are few comments specifying the details of the code.
* Name of the Problem
* Platform of the problem as codechef, hackerearth and all
* Link for the problem statement
* key concept: Algorithms, modulo etc..
* input and output criteria


Git commands I used:

0. git config --global user.name ""
   git config --global user.email ""
1. git init
2. git add README
3. git commit -m "Initial Commit"
4. git push origin master

To understand git and github more properly follow, my Understanding-Github repo, git-scm and try.github.com.  All these resources are well described in my Understanding-Github repo.

Note: At first visit, just solve the problem, later revisit the problem and Improve it to incorporate Dynamic programming.
